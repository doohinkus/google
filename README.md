#### _A web page that imitates the responsive design of think with Google_

#### By _**Rafael Perez**_

## Description

_Two examples of responsive layouts that imitate Think with Google. The first is accomplished with [pure css/media queries](https://doohinkus.github.io/google/) and the second was done using the CSS framework materialize. The [second version](https://doohinkus.github.io/google/materialize.html) relies on the framework heavily, there are no custom media queries. I wanted to learn materialize, so I tried to use as many built in features as possible, resorting to custom CSS styles as a last resort; as a result, the design does not follow the look and feel as closely as the pure css version, but the core behaviors for the layout are there._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone repository._
* _Double click "index.html"_
* _Or view the [Google Project](https://doohinkus.github.io/google/) now._


_If "index.html" fails to open when double clicked, then drag the file into your favorite browser._

## Known Bugs

_There are no known bugs at this time. The collapse menu for the pure CSS version is just a placeholder, it doesn't work, but the menu for the materialize version does work._

## Support and contact details

_If you have any issue with this code, please contact me._

## Technologies Used

_HTML & CSS. All effects are achieved with **CSS, NO JAVASCRIPT WHATSOEVER FOR MT
MY VERSION, THE MATERIALIZE VERSION DOES USE JQUERY!!!!**_
